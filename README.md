Reverse-String
==============

This is a small program that allows you to input any set of letter, and it will print the reverse order. In the code that I have complied, I have added a few additions that are not necessary for the program to run. First, I have only allowed 5 attempts before the program quits. The line that controls this is: if(j==5){. It can easily be altered by changing the value of j to whatever you wish.

Secondly, if "quit" is entered in the code, then the program will automatically break. The line that controls this is: if (input.equals("Quit")|| input.equals("quit")){. To add your own words, just change the words that are in quotation marks. 

Thirdly, I have added an extra line that is in doulble slashes, which means that it is a comment. You can delete the two slashes if you want the it to print the original line that was inputed. This line is : //System.out.print(x.charAt(z));

These are some small additions that I have added, but feel free to mess around with the code and message me alterations you have made to make the code better.
